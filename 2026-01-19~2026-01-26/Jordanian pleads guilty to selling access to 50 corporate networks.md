# Jordanian pleads guilty to selling access to 50 corporate networks

## Summary
A Jordanian man has pleaded guilty to operating as an "access broker" who sold access to the xomputer networks at least 50 companies.

40-year-old Feras Khalil Ahmad Albashiti (also known online as "r1z", "Feras Bashiti" and "Firas Bashiti") has entered a guilty plea to charges of fraud involving access credentials. Albashiti's sentencing is scheduled for May 11, 2026.

According to court documents, law enforcement officers investigating an online forum selling malware and malicious code in May 2023 identified Albashiti as the user behind the username "r1z".

He was charged after making the mistake of selling access to at least 50 victim companies' networks to an undercover law enforcement officer in exchange for cryptocurrenct on May 19, 2023.

The Justice Department's Office of International Affairs secured Albashiti's extradiction from Georgia where he lived and was arrested in July 2024.

## Note
### IAB(Initial Access Broker)
They secure entry points by exploiting vulnerable RDP/VPN configurations through credential stuffing or deploying infostealers to hijack session cookies and credentials. Beyond simple access, IABs demonstrate high technical proficiency by weaponizing N-day vulnerabilities in unpatched servers to establish persistent backdoors. Once inside, they perform privilege escalation to secure Domain Admin rights, transforming raw access into a "turnkey" product for buyers.
