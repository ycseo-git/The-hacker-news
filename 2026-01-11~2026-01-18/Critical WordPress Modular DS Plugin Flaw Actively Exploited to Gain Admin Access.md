# Critical WordPress Modular DS Plugin Flaw Actively Exploited to Gain Admin Access

## Summary
A maximum-severity security flaw in a WordPress plugin called Modular DS **has come under active exploitation in the wild**, according to Patchstack.

The vulnerability, **tracked as CVE-2026-23550(CVSS score 10.0)**, **has been described as a case of** unauthenticated privilege escalation impacting all versions of the plugin prior to including 2.5.1. It has been patched in version 2.5.2. The plugin has more than 40,000 active installs.

**The problem is rooted in** its routing mechanism, which is designed to put certain sensitive routes behind an authentication barrier. The plugin exposes its routes under the "/api/modular-connecter" prefix.

However, it has been found that this security layer can be bypassed every time "direct request" mode is enabled by supplying an "origin" parameter set to "mo" and a "type" parameter set to any value (e.g. "origin=mo&type=xxx").

Therefore, as soon as the site has already been connected to Modular, anyone can pass the auth middleware. This exposes several routes, including /login/, /sever-information/, /manager/, and /backup/, which **allow various actions to be performed**, **ranging from** remote login **to** obtaining sensitive system or user data.

As a result of this loophole, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit the "/login/{modular_request}" route to get administrator access, **resulting in** privilege escalation. 

According to details shard by the WordPress security company, attacks exploiting the flaw **are said to have been first detected** on January 13, 2026, at aroung 2 a.m. UTC, with HTTP GET calls to the endpoint "/api/modular-connector/login" followed by attempts to create an admin user.
