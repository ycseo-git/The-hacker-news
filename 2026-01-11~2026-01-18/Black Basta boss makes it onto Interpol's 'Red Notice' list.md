# Black Basta boss makes it onto Interpol's 'Red Notice' list

## Summary
The identity of the Black Basta ransomware gang leader has been confirmed by law enforcement in Ukraine and Germany, and the individual has been added to the wanted list of Europol and Interpol.

랜섬웨어 그룹  Black Basta의 리더의 신원이 우크라이나와 독일의 법 집행 기관에 의해 확인됐으며, 해당 인물이 유로폴과 인터폴의 지명수배 목록에 오른 것으로 드러났다.

Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) identified Oleg Evgenievich Nefedov, a 35-year-old Russian national, as the leader of the Black Basta ransomware gang.

The Ukranian police in collaboration with German authorities also identified two additional individuals allegedly working for the ransomware operation and conducted raids at two locations in the Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv regions.

"The attackers performed the functions of so-called hash crackers - individuals who specialize in extracting passwords to accounts from information systems using specialized sofrware", the press release explains.

After getting access credentials belonging to company employees, the suspects breached internal corporate systems and increased the privileges of the stolen accounts.

During the raids at the locations of the two suspected members of the Russian-affiliated hacker group, the Ukranian police seized digital storage and cryptocurrenct assets.

## Note
### Oleg Evgenievich Nefedov
While Nefedov is believed to be the founder and leader of Black Basta, there is also credible evidence linking him to Conti, a now-defunct ransomware syndicate that emerged in 2020 as a successor to Ryuk.

## Black Basta
After Conti shut down, it split into smaller cells that infiltrated other ransomware operations or took over existing ones. One of the new operations was Black Basta, considered a rebranding of the old Conti.

The ransomware-as-a-service(RaaS) operation emerged in April 2022 and is believed to be responsible for at least 600 ransomware incidents, data theft, and extortion targeting large organizations worldwide.

Notable victims include German defense contractor Rheinmetall, Hyundai's European division, BT Group(formerly British Telecom), and others.
