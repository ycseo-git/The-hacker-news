# Microfost Fixes 114 Windows Flaws in January 2026 Patch, One Actively Exploited

## Summary
Microsoft on Tuesday rolled out its first security update for 2026, addressing 114 security flaws, including one vulnerability that it said has been actively exploited in the wild. According to the data collected bt Fortra, the update marks the third-largest January Patch Tuesday after January 2025 and January 2022.

The vulnerability that has come under in-the-wild exploitation is CVE-2026-20805(CVSS Score 5.5), an information disclosure flaw impacting Desktop Window Manager. "Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor in Desktop Window Manager(DWM)" allows an authorized attacker to disclose information locally", Microsoft said in an advisory.

"The type of information that could be disclosed if an attacker successfully exploited this vulnerability is a section address from a remote ALPC port, which is user-mode memory."

There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being exploited, the scale of such efforts, and who may be behind the activity.

"DWM is responsible for drawing everything on the display of a Windows system, which means it offers an enticing combination of privileged access and universal availability, since just about any process might need to display something", Adam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid 7, said in a statement.

## Note
### Patch Tuesday
Microsoft's official schedule to release security updates on the second Tuesdat of every month. It provides a predictable cycle for IT administrators to manage system security. However, it also marks the start of "Exploit Wednesday", as hackers immediately begin reverse-engineering the patches to find ways to attack unpatched systems.

### Desktop Window Manager (DWM)
The window managemetn engine in Windows that handles all visual effects and rendering of the user interface. Since DWM needs to display windows for almost every process, it runs with high system privileges. This makes it a high-value target for attackers who want to gain control over the entire operating system.

### ALPC Ports
A high-speed communication channel used for "Inter-Process Communication(IPC)" within the Windows OS. The vulnerability in these ports allows unauthorized users to "eavesdrop" on sensitive data - specifically memory address - that should have been kept private.

### ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
A security feature that ransomly moves the locations of executable code and data in memory every time a program runs. Its goal is to prevent memory-based attacks (e.g. Buffer overflows) by making the target's location unpredictable. However, when a flaw like CVE-2026-20805 leaks memory addresses, the "randomness" of ASLR is defeated, allowing hackers to pinpoint their attack location.
